# UNiDAYS
Discounting Challenge

PROGRAM FUNCTIONS:
This BlueJ created program shows a splash screen with a menu of different items each with a unique discount
(such as Buy One Get One Free etc). The user can then input a character which corresponds to an item and it will
place that item into the basket. A user can add as many items to the basket as they want. Once they have finished
buying items, the program will calculate the total price of the users' items (with the discounts included) and will
display a final price, with a delivery charge if the price is less than Â£50. There is a test class that is purely
designed to test the different functions of the program. 

USER INSTRUCTIONS:
To start the program, right-click on the class labelled "UNiDAYSDiscountingChallenge" which will create an object. 
The user then right clicks on this object and selects the function named "addToBasket" and they will then be given
a prompt to insert their choice in the format "X" where X is their choice. Once they have added all these items to
their basket, they should click the calculate function and it will display the total on the screen in the terminal
which includes their delivery charge.
